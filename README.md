# bisparse-dep

This paper contains data and code from the NAACL 2018 paper ["Robust Cross-lingual Hypernymy Detection using Dependency Context"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11291).

# Data

The `data` directory contains two sub-directories :

- `hyper-hypo` : This dataset contains crowd-sourced hypernyms as positive examples, and crowd-sourced hyponymys as negative examples. This dataset has been used to generate results in Table 3a in the paper.
- `hyper-cohypo` : This dataset contains crowd-sourced hypernyms as positive examples, and automatically extracted co-hpyonyms as negative examples. This dataset has been used to generate results in Table 3b in the paper.

Both directories contain the exact tune/test split used in the paper, for each of four languages - Arabic (ar), French (fr), Russian (ru), and Chinese (zh). Additionally, `hyper-hypo` contains all examples that were crowdsourced - this is a superset of the tune/test data, and contains additional negative examples.

# Pre-trained vectors

The `pre-trained-vecs` directory contains the sparse, bilingual word vectors that have been used to generate the results in the paper. There are 2 vectors per langauge pair (ar-en, fr-en, ru-en, zh-en), per model (window, dependency, joint, delex, unlab), per dataset (hyper-hypo, hyper-cohypo), making for a total of 80 files. They have been organized by dataset, with each dataset folder containing 40 files

Additionally, each dataset folder also contains `hyperparams.txt` which gives the hyperparameters used to generate the vecctors and obtain the results.

# Scripts
- `balAPinc_multi_test.py` - Given a list of cross-lingual word pairs, and two cross-lingual word vector files (one per language), generate balAPinc scores for the word pairs
    - Syntax : `python scripts/balAPinc_multi_test.py <en-word-vectors> <non-en-word-vectors> <word-pairs-file> 0 <balAPinc-parameter> --prefix <optional prefix for output file> `, where
        -  <en-word-vectors> ::= File containing word vectors for English
        -  <non-en-word-vectors> ::= File containing word vectors for the other language
        -  <word-pairs-file> ::= List of (non-English, English) word pairs, with gold label (1 = English word is a hypernym of the non-English word, 0 = otherwise)
        -  <balAPinc-parameter> ::= How many features to include while calculating balAPinc? (Integer between 0 and 100, inclusive)
    -  Output : Input file, with a balAPinc score appended at the end of each line
    -  Example usage : `python scripts/balAPinc_multi_test.py pre-trained-vecs/hyper-hypo/ar-en.en.dep_1000.txt.gz pre-trained-vecs/hyper-hypo/ar-en.ar.dep_1000.txt.gz data/hyper-hypo/ar_tune.txt 0 100`
-  ` balAPinc_classification.py` - Given tune and test files, generate classification scores
    -  Syntax : `python scripts/balAPinc_classification.py --training <tune-word-file-with-scores> --test <test-word-file-with-scores>`, where
        - <tune-word-file-with-scores> ::= Output of `balAPinc_multi_test.py` when run on tuning data
        - <test-word-file-with-scores> ::= Output of `balAPinc_multi_test.py` when run on test data
- `generate_results.sh` - Run this to generate the results reported in the paper (currently generates all BiSparse-Dep (Full, Joint, Delex, Unlabeled) results in Tables 3a, 3b, and 4 )

Scripts to train vectors will be available soon. For now, you can use the scripts from our [prior work](https://github.com/yogarshi/bisparse) if needed.
